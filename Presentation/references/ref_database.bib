abstract = {Molecular dynamics calculations of the pressure and configurational energy of a Lennard-Jones fluid are reported for 108 state conditions in the density range 0{\textperiodcentered}35 ≦ $\rho$* ≦ 1{\textperiodcentered}20 and temperature range 0{\textperiodcentered}5 ≦ T* ≦ 6 (where $\rho$* = $\rho$$\sigma${\^{}}3, T* = kT/$\epsilon$). Particular attention is paid to the dense fluid region ($\rho$* ≧ 0{\textperiodcentered}9), including state conditions in the subcooled liquid region. These new simulation results for P and U are combined with those of previous workers, together with low density values calculated from the virial series and values of the second virial coefficients themselves, to derive an equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid that is valid over a wide range of temperatures and densities. The equation of state used is a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation having 33 constants. It fits the data well over the density range 0 ≦ $\rho$* ≦ 1{\textperiodcentered}2 and for T* values ranging from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 6{\textperiodcentered}0 (the exact temperature range depending to some extent on the density considered). We also calculate for the same range of state conditions, certain two- and three-body integrals (J, K and L) that occur in perturbation theory for molecular fluids. An interpolation formula is presented for the estimation of these integrals.},

@article{Trokhymchuk1999,
abstract = {Canonical molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for liquid/vapor equilibrium in truncated Lennard-Jones fluid have been carried out. Different results for coexistence properties (orthobaric densities, normal and tangential pressure profiles, and surface tension) have been reported in each method. These differences are attributed in literature to different set up conditions, e.g., size of simulation cell, number of particles, cut-off radius, time of simulations, etc., applied by different authors. In the present study we show that observed disagreement between simulation results is due to the fact that different authors inadvertently simulated different model fluids. The origin of the problem lies in details of truncation procedure used in simulation studies. Care has to be exercised in doing the comparison between both methods because in MC calculations one deals with the truncated potential, while in MD calculations one uses the truncated forces, i.e., derivative of the potential. The truncated force does not uniquely define the primordial potential. It results in MD and MC simulations being performed for different potential models. No differences in the coexistence properties obtained from MD and MC simulations are found when the same potential model is used. An additional force due to the discontinuity of the truncated potential at cut-off distance becomes crucial for inhomogeneous fluids and has to be included into the virial calculations in MC and MD, and into the computation of trajectories in MD simulations. The normal pressure profile for the truncated potential is constant through the interface and both vapor and liquid regions only when this contribution is taken into account, and ignoring it results in incorrect value of surface tension.},

@article{Smit1992,
abstract = {Smit and Frenkel' have shown that the phase diagram of the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid depends largely on the details of the truncation of the potential. In this Note, Gibbs-ensemble calculations are reported for the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid. As expected, the phase diagram for this system also depends significantly on the details of the truncation. The Lennard-Jones potential is defined by (1) where r is the distance between two particles. In a Monte Carlo simulation the potential is usually truncated at a distance r = R'. Simulations are performed with this trun-cated potential. The influence of the tail of the potential is usually estimated analytically, by assuming that g(r) = 1 for distances greater than the cut-off radius. If one is in-terested in interfacial properties, this tail correction cannot be added straightforwardly. The simulations are then per-formed with a truncated potential 4(r) r{\textless}RC,},

@article{Johnson1993,
abstract = {We review the existing simulation data and equations of state for the Lennard- Jones (L J) fluid, and present new simulation results for both the cut and shifted and the full LJ potential. New parameters for the modified Benedict- Webb-Rubin (MBWR) equation of state used by Nicolas, Gubbins, Streett and Tildesley are presented. In contrast to previous equations, the new equation is accurate for calculations of vapour-liquid equilibria. The equation also accurately correlates pressures and internal energies from the triple point to about 4.5 times the critical temperature over the entire fluid range. An equation of state for the cut and shifted LJ fluid is presented and compared with the simulation data of this work, and previously published Gibbs ensemble data. The MBWR equation of state can be extended to mixtures via the van der Waals one-fluid theory mixing rules. Calculations for binary fluid mixtures are found to be accurate when compared with Gibbs ensemble simulations.},
